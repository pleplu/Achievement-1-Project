Write two to three sentences on why Django is so popular among web developers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Django comes pre packaged with plenty of tools that developers might need for their projects.
Django is also very well documented; offering plenty of support if problems should arise.


After some research, list five large companies that use Django. Specify what the company’s product or service is and what they use Django for.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The list of companies includes, but is not limited to: Instagram, Youtube, Netflix, Pintrest, Spotify. These companies offer either music/video streaming or 
host social media content. All of these companies use Django for their back-end support.


For each of the following scenarios, explain if you would use Django (and why or why not):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to develop a web application with multiple users.

    Django would work well for this project due to its built in user managment features.

You need fast deployment and the ability to make changes as you proceed.

    Django would also work very well for projects that require a speedy development as it's MVT architecture provides a clear and consistent guide.

You need to build a very basic application, which doesn’t require any database access or file operations.

    Django would not be necessary for projects that don't require any database access or file operations as that is Django's main utility.

You want to build an application from scratch and want a lot of control over how it works.

    Also because of Django's MVT sctructure providing a clear guide, it would be great for building applications from scratch.

You’re about to start working on a big project and are afraid of getting stuck and needing additional support.

    Django is a well documented framework that offers plenty of support so this won't be a concern.
