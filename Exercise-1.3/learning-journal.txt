Exercise-1.1

So far I've only learned the very basics of coding with Python, but I hope to learn how I can use Python in my full time career as a web developer.


Exercise-1.2

1.  Imagine you’re having a conversation with a future colleague about whether to use the iPython Shell instead of Python’s default shell. 
    What reasons would you give to explain the benefits of using the iPython Shell over the default one?

    A: iPython has better UI features and tools that the standard Python Shell lacks, making it better for developers when testing either full scripts or code snipits. 

2.	Python has a host of different data types that allow you to store and organize information. 
    List 4 examples of data types that Python recognizes, briefly define them, and indicate whether they are scalar or non-scalar.

    A: Interger - Whole numbers both positive and negative. Scalar
       Boolean - True or False. Scalar
       Tuple - A collections of different objects. Non-scalar
       List - Store multiple data types in a single variable. Non-scalar


3.	A frequent question at job interviews for Python developers is: what is the difference between lists and tuples in Python? 
    Write down how you would respond.

    A: The main difference between lists and tuples is that while lists can be manipulated through your scripts, tuples cannot. In other words, lists are mutables
       and tuples are immutable. 

4.	In the task for this Exercise, you decided what you thought was the most suitable data structure for storing all the information for a recipe. 
    Now, imagine you’re creating a language-learning app that helps users memorize vocabulary through flashcards. 
    Users can input vocabulary words, definitions, and their category (noun, verb, etc.) into the flashcards. 
    They can then quiz themselves by flipping through the flashcards. 
    Think about the necessary data types and what would be the most suitable data structure for this language-learning app. 
    Between tuples, lists, and dictionaries, which would you choose? 
    Think about their respective advantages and limitations, 
    and where flexibility might be useful if you were to continue developing the language-learning app beyond vocabulary memorization. 

    A: As far as standard flashcards go, I would use tuples for the majority of my app to store my data. Being that I'm simply storing a word with a description
       and defintion that won't need to be updated or changed later to store additional data, tuples will be more than okay. While lists or dictionaries are more 
       dynamic, I just don't see this need for these addtional features in the current state of my app.


Exercise-1.3

1.	Imagine you’re at a job interview for a Python developer role. The interviewer says “Explain logical operators in Python”. Draft how you would respond.

    A: Logical operators are used in conditional statements to determine how the statement will be read to decide whether it is true or false. 

2.	What are functions in Python? When and why are they useful?

    A: Python functions are built in tools that let you interact and manipulate your code. They can be used to gather and update information from user manipulation
    or designate data types and structures.

3.	In the section for Exercise 1 in this Learning Journal, you were asked in question 3 to set some goals for yourself while you complete this course.  
    In preparation for your next mentor call, make some notes on how you’ve progressed towards your goals so far.

    A: Now I better understand the different data types, and how to better implement python fucntions into my code.


Exercise-1.4

1.	Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store local files?

    A

2.	In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the pickle.dump() method. 
    What are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why? 

    A

3.	In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you wanted to change your current working directory?

    A   

4.	Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of code. 
    How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error?

    A

5.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 1! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. 
    How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? 
    Feel free to use these notes to guide your next mentor call.

    A


Exercise-1.5

1. In your own words, what is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?

    A

2. What are objects and classes in Python? Come up with a real-world example to illustrate how objects and classes work.

    A

3. In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine.

a. Inheritance
b. Polymorphism
c. Operator Overloading


    A


Exercise-1.6

1.	What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

    A

2.	List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

    A

3.	In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

    A

4.	Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

    A

5.	Now that you’re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. 
    What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

    A

    A

2.	By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? 
    If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve?

    A

3.	Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. 
    Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.

    A
